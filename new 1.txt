Dear Khalfan,
Please see below the instructions on reporting your relocation expenses in Concur. All the links are available. Here is the
link to log in to your Concur profile.
I have requested access to /Relocation/EU/ES cost-object for you and shortly you will be able to report your expenses
based on:
transactions covered by EPAM corporate credit card and
your out-of-pocket expenses (scans of receipts for those costs should be attached), which are covered by
EPAM for your relocation to Spain according to Global Mobility Relocation Policy. 
IMPORTANT
We highly recommend watching this 6 minute video training in English that shows how to report your expenses.
All expenses should be reported within 30 days from the hire date at EPAM Spain. Please try to complete your ER ASAP. If
ER is submitted, verified/approved and sent for payment before the 15-th day of the current month, then you’ll get
compensation in the current payroll (usually happens in the end of the month). If it's done after the 15-th day, payment will be
included to the next payroll.
If you do not have all transactions or receipts available to report within this period, please include as many as you can in
one expense report (ER) and submit it. 
Please submit all remaining expenses within the 30-day period as mentioned above. It is the employee’s responsibility to
collect receipts and add respective transactions to relocation expense reports on time.
Please check the short summary of action items to report your expenses:
1. Create an Expense Report (scroll down KB page to "How to create Expense Report from scratch") in Concur
adding the above Cost Object or open already available Expense Report (if any).
2. Create Expenses in the Expense Report for the costs paid from your pocket (e.g. documents legalization, taxi).
Always choose “No” in the Billable field.
3. Attach receipts/invoices and comments where needed.
4. Submit your Expense Report once all the Expenses have been created by you and/or reassigned by me to your
profile (please minimize the number of expense reports).
Travelling by a personal car: to get reimbursement, you should create a Personal Car Mileage Expense in your ER and
apply mileage calculator where start and end points of the trip should be mentioned.
Here is a link to the guide on how to properly report reassigned transactions in Concur. Please do not press the “Delete”
button instead of “Move” in a report with reassigned transactions or they will return to the cardholder's account. 
Following the link you can get acquainted with the expense report statuses and timelines for the reimbursement
In case you have any questions about reporting the expenses, please refer to WFAExpenseManagement@epam.com
team for the assistance.

Hi Khalfan,
This is to inform you that I re-assigned transactions from the corporate cards for your Spain logistics to your account in
Concur and added them to the report “ Relocation to Spain” and now you can add your out of pocket expenses to this
report. Kindly note all expenses should be reported within 30 days from the hire date at EPAM Spain.

Hi Kateryna,
Hope you are doing well.
I wanted to discuss with you, I couldn't find an apartment yet and I have only 2 working days left.
I have tried but now the question is, if I couldn't find any apartment before 3 May 2022, then what are the options I have?
Can you extend it for few days until I find a long-term apartment?

Hi Khalfan,
Please let me know for how many days you will need the extension? As I will need to check the availability of an
apartment and get approval from the financial director.
Also, you can contact our colleagues from Softlanding orgsoftlandingteames@epam.com, they might help you finding a
long-term apartment.

Hi Kateryna,
I am already working with Softlanding Team, hopefully we will find an apartment soon.
But can you extend current accommodation till 14 May. I’ll inform you once I get the apartment.
Please share you thoughts.

Hi Kateryna,
Few appointments for visiting apartments are coming in next week. Can I schedule them, or I must wait for your response
on approval? 
Your quick response will be highly appreciated.

Hi Khalfan,
Please note the apartment you are staying in now can’t be prolonged as it is already booked. So, currently I am still
waiting for the available options of apartments in order to make a prolongation of it till May 14 from GM side. After that I
will need to get an approval for such extension from our financial director.
Re your permanent apartment – yes, please proceed searching preferable options for you.
